# Social_Network_API

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Description

This application relies on Insomnia Core for its operation. Once connected, the mongoose models synchronize with the database, allowing access to user and thought data through the routes directory. Users have the option to add other users as friends, and they can also post reactions to thoughts using a POST request. Additionally, thoughts and reactions can be modified or removed using PUT and DELETE requests.
